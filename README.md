## Problem: 

 - Create a component which can render a form from a json configuration. 
      components should support the following input fields. 
     1. text
     2. password
     3. select (dropdown single and multiple select)
     4. Radio
     5. checkbox
     6. file upload

- All the input field should be able to have a regex validation if the regex is a valid one. 
- use formik for rendering the form and fields.
